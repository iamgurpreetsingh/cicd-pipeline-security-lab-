# cicd-pipeline-security-lab-
Hands-on CI/CD pipeline security learning project focused on understanding and mitigating common DevSecOps risks.

## Overview
This repository documents a hands-on learning project focused on exploring
security risks in CI/CD pipelines and the software supply chain.

The project follows a learn-by-doing approach:
- build a basic CI/CD pipeline
- intentionally introduce insecure configurations
- observe and analyze security risks
- apply security controls to mitigate those risks

This is an ongoing learning project conducted in a controlled lab environment.

## Learning Goals
- Understand CI/CD pipeline execution and permissions
- Identify common CI/CD security misconfigurations
- Simulate pipeline abuse and supply-chain attack scenarios
- Apply foundational DevSecOps security controls
- Document risks, impact, and mitigations clearly

## Technologies (Learning Focus)
- Git and GitHub
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- Docker
- Basic security scanning tools
